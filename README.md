This is a [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb) project using [KotlinBootstrap](https://github.com/stevdza-san/KotlinBootstrap) framework for some UI elements and [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) ORM framework


## Getting Started

First, run the development server by typing the following command in a terminal under the `site` folder:

```bash
$ cd site
$ kobweb run
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

You can use any editor you want for the project, but we recommend using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** downloaded
using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Press `Q` in the terminal to gracefully stop the server.



Kobweb also supports exporting to a static layout which is compatible with static hosting providers, such as GitHub
Pages, Netlify, Firebase, any presumably all the others. You can read more about that approach here:
