This is a [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb) project using [KotlinBootstrap](https://github.com/stevdza-san/KotlinBootstrap) framework for some UI elements and [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) ORM framework.

This is a static website whose purpose was for practising my web skills since it involved a mix of different concepts.

I used [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs) ES to build the Pizza chatbot and integrated it into the front-end.

The entire project is Kotlin with the front-end using Compose-HTML which contains a mix of typical Compose, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I used AI generated pizza pictures too, courtesy of [Windows Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/copilot-ai-features)

The backend is pure Kotlin.




## Getting Started

First, run the development server by typing the following command in a terminal under the `site` folder:

```bash
$ cd site
$ kobweb run
```

Open [http://localhost:8080/homepage](http://localhost:8080/homepage) with your browser to see the result.

You can use any editor you want for the project, but I recommend using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** downloaded
using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Press `Q` in the terminal to gracefully stop the server.
